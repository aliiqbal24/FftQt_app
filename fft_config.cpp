/* Improvements
 *
 * FIX 1st time Crash, when the mode switches, only happens when the app is first loaded
 *
 * Add comments on code
 *
 * consider starting off, and using turns it on with one button

 *
 * the slider between the plots should be visible
 *
 * Allows for device connecivity after program launched like pteradactyl -
 *
 * Consider
 *
 * FIX adjustable time, no more bugs, allow up to 10 sec both modes
 * panning and zoom in/out on graphs
 * light mode/ dark mode
 * performance statistics
 *

/* Testing
 *
 * Peak frequency is always 0, or low, test to see if it is adaptive, and reacts to unique peaks
 * crashes
 *
 * for high bandwidth mode, the nyquist edge is peaking randomly, wierd, - spectral leakage

/* UI
