// fft_config.cpp
// Header‑only constants — nothing to implement here.


/* Improvements
 *
 * MODULARIZE CODE!!!!
 *
 *
 * Allow for greater FFT sizes - start with making it work in terminal, then shift to our plotting program
 * Build off the the vs code version, experiment with pure MKL  interface - might be break through
 * Ask about RI stream, how come now download
 *
 *
 * FIX adjustable time, no more bugs, allow up to 10 sec both modes
 * panning and zoom in/out on graphs
 * light mode/ dark mode
 * performance statistics
 *
 */

/* Testing
 *
 * Peak frequency is always 0, or low, test to see if it is adaptive, and reacts to unique peaks
 * crashes
