/* Improvements
 *
 * Add comments on code
 *
 * Ask Ayden,
 * should we lower the size at low bandwidth
 * show the math, currently 10hz error in low bandwidth, kinda od for 100K
 *
 * consider starting off, and using turns it on with one button
 * This same as Pause Play button?
 * Allows for device connecivity after program launched like pteradactyl -
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Consider
 *
 * FIX adjustable time, no more bugs, allow up to 10 sec both modes
 * panning and zoom in/out on graphs
 * light mode/ dark mode
 * performance statistics
 *
 */

/* Testing
 *
 * Peak frequency is always 0, or low, test to see if it is adaptive, and reacts to unique peaks
 * crashes
 *
 * for high bandwidth mode, the nyquist edge is peaking randomly, wierd, - spectral leakage
